Going to put the Flask API and actual engine logic in here.

SETUP:
download Python 3.10 from MS Store
enter command "pip install flask-cors" in terminal
enter command "pip install dotenv" in VS terminal

Make sure you're in the engine directory
run "python app.py" in terminal
go to localhost:8000/hello (subject to change based on paths)

Also, you're going to need the .env file, but we obviously can't put the database credentials in the code. Message me and I'll send you the variables; make sure you name the file ".env" in the engine folder so that the .gitignore won't commit it.
