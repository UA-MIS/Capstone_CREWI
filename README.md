Before developing, be sure to watch and follow the setup video.

To access the codebase, use the capstonecrewi Github account:

The Capstone_CREWI repo has the code for the project, but the crewiStaticFiles repo is also necessary for updating the widget (discussed in more detail in the widget ReadMe).
