### Capstone_CREWI Codebase

Before developing, be sure to watch and follow the setup video.

To access the codebase, use the capstonecrewi Github account:

Email: capstonecrewi@gmail.com
Username: capstonecrewi
Password: CapstoneCREWI2022!

The Capstone_CREWI repo has the code for the project, but the crewiStaticFiles repo is also necessary for updating the widget (discussed in more detail in the widget ReadMe).

For questions, reach out to me via email at stward1@crimson.ua.edu


### Current State of Deployment

Right now, there is a Heroku server for the engine and one for the one-page. The widget is "hosted" via the crewiStaticFiles repo. The servers are currently down; use the Capstone CREWI credentials to sign into Heroku and deploy them again.

The MySQL database is hosted already; use the credentials in the .env file (or from the configuration variables in engine Heroku server) to connect and view the data as needed.
