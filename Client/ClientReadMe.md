For now, let's just make the one-page in here as a React App.

The widget can be a part of it; we can encapsulate it later. In theory, we should be able to compile it with parcel and reference it in the one-page.

If any of that sounds weird or doesn't sound right, you probably know the structure better than I do so feel free to make a judgement call on folder structure.
