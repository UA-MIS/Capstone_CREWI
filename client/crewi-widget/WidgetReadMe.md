### CREWI Widget ReadMe

This is the CREWI Widget. It can embedded in any front-end by loading in a few of the static files. Note that the one-page is not part of this; the widget and one-page are two separate React apps.


### `npm start`

Runs the widget locally. This is good for developing features and testing.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### `npm run build`

Use this to update the static files. Whenever you change stuff in the widget, make sure to run this command to update the static files. Check the terminal to see which files are needed to embed the widget (typically one JS file, a CSS file, and a chunk JS file).
